# Next.js + Jest

This example shows how to configure Jest to work with Next.js.

This includes Next.js' built-in support for Global CSS, CSS Modules and TypeScript. It originally came from the `with-jest` [example from Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-jest).

I've updated the example to add in the following:

- [react-query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/)
  - Incorporating the [snippets from the react-query docs for v3](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/testing-react-query)
- [msw](https://mswjs.io/)
  - Following the [official next.js example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-msw)
